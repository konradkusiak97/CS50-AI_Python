# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python


 Below, I listed all my weekly projects from an online course I pursued through the __Edx__ platform of the above title. The course focuses on an introduction to AI concepts such as _Machine Learning_ and _Neural Networks_. 
 
 Each project has a separate folder with all its code, description, and a link to a video in which I present how my program runs. 
 
 The more detialed description and further information is on the website of the [course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/).
